<p>This app was designed to help people locate services and places that make our campus more inclusive. Right now we are focusing on gender-inclusive restrooms, but keep on the lookout for other updates, as well.</p>
 
<p>The app includes a map of gender-inclusive restrooms, which is helpful for many populations on campus such as parents with small children, people whose personal care attendants are different genders from them, and transgender or non-binary people looking for a safe place to use the restroom. </p>
 
<p>The app working group, started in the UT Libraries, includes representatives from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (DDCE), the Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC), and Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD).</p>

<p>Inclusive U was first developed on iOS and later on Android, following the model of the iOS app. We use a combination of the Google Maps SDK and custom Google maps that allows us to display the buildings containing the restrooms. Additionally this allows us to download the custom map .kml file when the app is opened to so that the buildings and rooms are always up to date (and don't require an app update in order to add new buildings).</p>

<p>Primary development has been by Jeremy Thompson (<a href="https://github.com/mrjeremyt" class="user-mention">@mrjeremyt</a>), with Connor White developing the Android version.</p>
